	 * @todo -- Create a class that organizes and exports the data of a model run. Bonus points - if
	 * you can create a procedure that allows the model to record the data at a) the last time step,
	 * and b) for every time step (creating a spreadsheet that would have #Provinces X #steps rows.
	 * Yes, I know thats crazy, but it will be a useful option to have). If you want super mega
	 * bonus points, it would have a parameter that would say "record the model at every X time
	 * steps."
